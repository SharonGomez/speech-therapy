# Exploring Procedural Methods for Use in SpeechTherapy for Aphasia Patients

The project as part of my master's thesis investigates procedural methods for helping with the rehabilitation of patients with Aphasia, a language disorder resulting from the damage to region of brain that handles language. A procedural approach means that the application could be easily adapted to individual patients.

Giving the patient different cues and evaluating their response to stimulate and facilitate improvement is part of the project.

### Visual Cue: Real time Procedural Generation of Animation Based on Audio

Procedurally animating metahumans based on audios would enable speech therapists to provide visual cues for the patient to practice with by simply adding in audios to practice before next consultation.  
For the real time procedural generation of the facial animation on the Metahuman to play along with the audio improvements were made on top of the Oculus Lipsync module to make the animation better and more profound, control the speed and make the process realtime.


### Real Time Conversion of Speech to Text to Assess the Response of the Patient

One of the main issues with aphasia is causing disconnect between what a person thinks and says. Without proper feedback the patient might feel like what they are saying is correct. To avoid this, when the patient speaks the audio is converted to text real time and compared with the expected outcome. There is an option to slow down the audio and animation to enable easy practice. Doing practice with an avatar would enable practice without fear of judgment.
For the real time conversion of speech to text of the patients, the Runtime Speech Recognizer based on the Whisper OpenAI Technology was used.
